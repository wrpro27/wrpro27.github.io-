      <h3>My Current Project: QUEST Process Improvement Project</h3>
      <h4>Client: TerrapinWorks Student Competition Workspace</h4>
      <p>Within TerrapinWorks, the Student Competitions Workspace is an area where multiple student organizations and competition teams gain access to machinery, robotics, and advising to showcase their innovation. With the variety of different groups within the environment, it raises an issue of efficiently servicing and monitoring training. The goal of our project is to reconstruct the approach the Student Competitions Workspace uses to address safety training, while implementing an online software to distribute and record training modules that are relevant to each student group.</p>

    <h3>QUEST Product Innovation Project</h3>
    <h4>Product: Biodegradable Pipette Tip Reloader</h4>
    <p>Throughout two months of design thinking and ideation, our team was able to design an eco-friendly product that helped to eliminate plastic lab waste. “Sustain-O-Tips” is a product that provides a convenient, low cost pipette tip loading system without excess plastic waste. Our product consists of a two-part grid formation, which perfectly aligns with the box for a quick and easy reload. Once the tips are loaded in, the product can then be disassembled and composted. Through the completion of our project, our team has officially participated in the World's Largest Lesson, as our biodegradable lab waste solution supports the 12th Sustainable Development Goal of Responsible Consumption and Production.</p>
