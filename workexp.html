As this was a brand new location, I spent the first five weeks of my summer setting up the store, locating and organizing 8 figures of inventory. Once the store was fully built, we had our grand opening around halfway through the summer. Throughout the rest of the summer, I greeted and engaged thousands of customers and provided product recommendations according to their needs. I also performed several hundred golf club repairs, including re-gripping and re-shafting services. After the store close, I would organize and locate inventory on the sales floor and in the back stock, upholding inventory presentation and replenishment standards. I really enjoyed this job, as it helped me improve upon my organizational and interpersonal skills. I got to meet a lot of cool people through this job, and I also had a lot of fun performing various golf services.</p></div></div><div class="work-exp"><div><h3>Summer 2021 + 2022 - Calvert Hall Baseball</h3><h4>Position: Youth Baseball Coach</h4><p>Throughout the summer during my later years in high school, I served as a youth baseball coach for the weekly baseball camps that were hosted at my high school. As a coach at these camps, I was responsible for overseeing groups of over 20 children ages 4 to 7. As I have a younger sibling, I am very good at engaging young children, so I was given the responsibility of coaching the younger groups. I organized creative and entertaining activities to keep all of these young athletes engaged, which was a difficult feat considering I had to keep them occupied for 8+ hours per day. Throughout the day, I coached young children on hitting, fielding, and pitching skills, through both group and individual activities.</p></div></div><div class="work-exp"><div><h3>Professional Interests</h3><ul style="list-style-type:square"><li>Blockchain Technology</li><li>Strategy Consulting</li><li>Investment Management</li></ul></div></div></body></html>
